To access the Docker container and run commands inside it, follow these steps:

1. List Running Docker Containers
First, you need to find the container ID or name of the Docker container you want to access:

bash
Copy code
sudo docker ps
This will list all running containers along with their IDs and names.

2. Access the Container
Use the docker exec command to start an interactive shell session inside the container. Replace CONTAINER_ID with the actual ID or name of your container:

bash
Copy code
sudo docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash
For example, if your container ID is f13dfaf769bf, the command would be:

bash
Copy code
sudo docker exec -it f13dfaf769bf /bin/bash
3. Run Commands Inside the Container
Once youâ€™re inside the container, you can navigate to the /ros_noetic_base_2204/catkin_ws directory and run commands just as you would on your host machine.

bash
Copy code
cd /ros_noetic_base_2204/catkin_ws
# Now you can run commands inside the container
4. Exit the Container
To exit the container, simply type exit and press Enter.

bash
Copy code
exit
Example Workflow
Find Container ID:

bash
Copy code
sudo docker ps
Access the Container:

bash
Copy code
sudo docker exec -it f13dfaf769bf /bin/bash
Navigate and Work Inside:

bash
Copy code
cd /ros_noetic_base_2204/catkin_ws
Exit the Container:

bash
Copy code
exit
This process will allow you to interact with the Docker container and perform actions as needed.
